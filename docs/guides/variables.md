:woman_student: **Level**: Intermediate

## 1. Add Input
To show interactivity we need an interactive component. Let's **add an input**.

> Technical Note: For Interactive Elements you need an `React.ChangeEventHandler` or `React.EventHandler` property.

## 2. Define a variable
Below the input properties you'll find an **Interaction Property**. **Set it to** `Set Variable`.
Next **give it a name** by typing in your desired name.
Lastly you need to define the **Payload**. Set it to `value`.

## 3. Link component to a value
To make use of your defined variable, you need to consume it in a component.
In the *Input* component click on the *link* icon at the *value property* and select your previously defined variable.

## 4. Start typing away
You input component now accepts the value you type in. yay!
