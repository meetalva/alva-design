# Guide 1 – Essentials
In this guide you will learn how Alva works, how to add code components and how to adjust their properties.

### (1) Add a Text Component
On the left bottom you find the *component libraries*. Drag a the text component from there and drop it on the element list above. That’s it – we added your first component to our prototype!

### (2) Adjust a Property
After you selected the newly added text component, have a look at the right side of Alva. There are all *properties* – like settings – of the component shown. In this case it’s just a single one – the text value. Let’s change that to `Hello Alva!`.

### (3) Add a Box Component
Let’s add another component. Besides dragging a component, we just double-click on the *Box Component*. The Box Component has way more properties, it actually is a entire flexbox engine. Let’s change the *height* to `400px` and the *background-color* to `#DA046E`.

### (4) Re-Order Elements
As you already may have found out, elements that support children elements have a small arrow on the left side. You can drag and drop elements into them. Let’s do that with the text element!

### (5) Export Prototype
It’s quite simple – but we already created our first little project. In the era of code-driven design tools we won’t need any static image exports like PNG or PDF anymore. So let’s step into the new world and export our project as a HTML prototype. Just hit the *Export* Button on the right top and save somewhere you like.

You can now open that HTML file now from every computer or host it somewhere to share it with the world.

### Next
Hooray! You learned the essentials of working with Alva. Let’s jump to the next topic – how to integrate your design drafts into the prototype.
